#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development, ensuring that software is reliable, efficient, scalable, and maintainable. It involves requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.	Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
o	The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the software crisis, where large software projects were failing due to poor management, inefficiency, and lack of structured development methods.
o	This led to the adoption of systematic approaches to software development.
2.	Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s)
o	Winston Royce introduced the Waterfall Model, a structured approach to software development with sequential phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
o	It provided a disciplined method but lacked flexibility for changing requirements.
3.	Agile Methodology Emergence (2001)
o	The Agile Manifesto was introduced to promote iterative, flexible, and customer-focused software development.
o	Agile replaced rigid methodologies like Waterfall with adaptive frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), emphasizing continuous feedback and rapid delivery



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis

Gather and define the project’s requirements, ensuring clarity on functionalities, user needs, and constraints.
Planning

Define project scope, timeline, resources, and budget. A feasibility study is conducted to assess risks and technical viability.
Design

Create system architecture, UI/UX design, and database structures based on requirements. This phase includes high-level (system) and low-level (detailed) design.
Implementation (Coding)

Developers write the actual code using programming languages and frameworks, following best practices and coding standards.
Testing

The software undergoes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to identify and fix bugs before deployment.
Deployment

The software is released to users in a staging or production environment. Deployment may be done in phases or all at once.
Maintenance

Post-deployment, the software is monitored for bugs, performance issues, and updates. This includes bug fixes, security patches, and feature enhancements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a linear and structured process, where each phase is completed before moving to the next. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible, allowing continuous improvements throughout the development cycle.
Waterfall is suitable for: government, regulatory, or defense projects, where compliance, security, and thorough documentation are essential.
for banking or infrastructure systems, where predictability and rigorous testing are required before deployment.
While Agile is suitable for: startups and tech companies, where innovation and flexibility are necessary to stay competitive.
for e-commerce websites or social media platforms, where user needs evolve rapidly, and frequent updates are required.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
Writes, tests, and maintains code to build software applications.
Collaborates with designers and stakeholders to implement features.
Debugs and optimizes code for performance and efficiency.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Designs and executes test cases to identify bugs and ensure software quality.
Works on automation testing to improve efficiency.
Collaborates with developers to fix issues and improve product reliability.

Project Manager
Plans, organizes, and oversees the software development process.
Ensures deadlines, budgets, and project goals are met.
Coordinates communication between teams and stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): IDEs enhance productivity by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform. They help with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time error detection, making development faster and more efficient.
Examples:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Lightweight and supports multiple languages with extensions.
IntelliJ IDEA – Popular for Java development with advanced debugging and refactoring tools.
PyCharm – Specifically designed for Python development with strong support for frameworks.

Version Control Systems (VCS):  VCS enables collaboration, tracks changes, and allows developers to revert to previous versions if issues arise. It ensures project stability and maintains a history of modifications.
Examples:
Git – The most widely used VCS, allowing distributed development and used with platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
Subversion (SVN) – A centralized version control system used in enterprise environments.
Mercurial – A scalable and efficient alternative to Git for handling large projects.
Both IDEs and VCS are essential in modern software development for efficiency, collaboration, and maintaining code quality.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including:
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
 Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation, and helps identify bugs early in the development process.
Example: Testing a login function to ensure it correctly validates user credentials.

Integration Testing: Verifies that different modules or services work together correctly, and detects issues in data flow and communication between components.
Example: Checking if the user authentication system interacts properly with the database.

System Testing: evaluates the complete system against specified requirements, ensures the software works as a whole in different environments.
Example: Testing an entire e-commerce website, including login, checkout, and payment processing.

Acceptance Testing: determines if the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment, and is usually performed by end-users or clients.
Example: A company testing a new payroll system before rolling it out to employees.

Importance in Software Quality Assurance
Prevents defects by catching bugs early.
Ensures reliability by verifying interactions between components.
Enhances user experience by validating the system as a whole.
Builds confidence by confirming the software meets business needs before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the ability to give instructions to an AI model like Chatgpt so that it does exactly what you want.
The importance of prompt engineering is that the more you know how to ask a model the more you get what you exactly want.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
The improved prompt will give me more specific answers adapted to what I asked.
